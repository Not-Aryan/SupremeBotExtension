# SupremeBotExtension

This is a Supreme Bot that will take user input and use that to checkout a supreme item.

I first made the bot portion of the program in Python, and I used the libraries Beautiful Soup and Selenium.

I then tried to design a user input section, and I eventually decided on creating a google chrome extension which would take input from a form and relay that to my python bot.

To accomplish this, I added flask functionality to my python script and used Ajax to send POST requests. This allowed my google chrome extension to communicate with my python bot, and the project was complete.
